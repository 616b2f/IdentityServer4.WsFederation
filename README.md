# IdentityServer4.WsFederation
**Sample** for implementing WS-Federation IdP support for IdentityServer4

## Overview
IdentityServer4 is designed to be extendable with custom protocol endpoints.
This repo shows a simple implementation of WS-Federation IdP services.
This is useful for connecting SharePoint or older ASP.NET relying parties to IdentityServer.

**This is not supposed to be a generic WS-Federation implementation, but is rather a sample that you can use 
as a starting point to build your own WS-Federation support (or even for integrating other custom protocols, which 
are not natively support by IdentityServer4).**
